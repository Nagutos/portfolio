    "title": "Systems and Network Administrator",
    "subtitle": "Sociable and dynamic IT technician, specialized in systems and networks with solid training in cybersecurity.",
    "Paragraph1": "My name is Maxime and I am 21 years old. Passionate about IT, I have explored various fields by learning and practicing on my own in my spare time. Although my initial interest was in hardware and electronics, I gradually moved towards computer programming. My curiosity and attention to detail allow me to learn every day and constantly broaden my knowledge.",
    "Paragraph2": "Today I am able to develop in Java, C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and to carry out web development with React and Vue.js. In addition, I manage and maintain a self-hosted infrastructure, mainly composed of Docker containers and a NAS server, which allows me to host different services, isolate them and experiment with various technologies.",
    "Paragraph3": "For several years, due to my interest in animation, particularly Japanese animation, I have been interested in how audiovisual content is produced and distributed. I first learned the art of subtitling (translation, timing, typesetting) with Aegisub, in order to best integrate French into Japanese works. Later, I became interested in encoding, then in video filtering with VapourSynth, two fields that arouse my curiosity and passion.",
    "Paragraph4": "In this portfolio you will find my educational and professional background, the skills I possess, my interests, some of my projects, my extracurricular activities, as well as the various ways to contact me. I wish you an excellent reading!"
